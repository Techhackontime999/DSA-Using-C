// Bucket Sort
// Bucket Sort is distributes elements into buckets and then sorts these buckets individually. It is often used when the input is uniformly distributed over a range.

// Example:
// Consider the list [0.78, 0.17, 0.39, 0.26, 0.72, 0.94, 0.21, 0.12, 0.23, 0.68].

// Distribute into buckets: [[0.17, 0.12, 0.21, 0.23], [0.26, 0.39], [0.68, 0.72, 0.78], [0.94]].

// Sort each bucket: [[0.12, 0.17, 0.21, 0.23], [0.26, 0.39], [0.68, 0.72, 0.78], [0.94]].

// Concatenate buckets: [0.12, 0.17, 0.21, 0.23, 0.26, 0.39, 0.68, 0.72, 0.78, 0.94].

// Use Cases:
// Effective for sorting uniformly distributed data.

// Used in graphics and computational geometry for sorting points in space.

// Suitable for sorting floating-point numbers in a specific range.
