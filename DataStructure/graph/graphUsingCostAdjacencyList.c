//in cost Adjacency list representation of graph looks like below
//in place of writing only connected node in connection list write connected node + cost particular of connection
//here in connection list [ ] [ ] first box value represent connected node and second box value represent cost of particular connection
// Node       Connection-list
// 0     ->     [ 4 ][ 10 ] -> [ 2 ][ 16 ] -> [ 1 ][ 14 ]
// 1     ->     [ 0 ][ 19 ] -> [ 5 ][ 18 ] 
// 2     ->     [ 0 ][ 13 ] -> [ 4 ][ 10 ] -> [ 3 ][ 11 ]
// 3     ->     [ 2 ][ 05 ] -> [ 5 ][ 20 ] 
// 4     ->     [ 0 ][ 08 ] -> [ 2 ][ 01 ] 
// 5     ->     [ 1 ][ 07 ] -> [ 3 ][ 00 ]
